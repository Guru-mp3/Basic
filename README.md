## Theory about input and output functions in C
Input means to provide the program with some data to be used in the program and Output means to display data on screen or write the data to a printer or a file. C programming language provides many built-in functions to read any given input and to display data on screen when there is a need to output the result. The standard input-output header file, named stdio.h contains the definition of the functions printf() and scanf(), which are used to display output on screen and to take input from user respectively.
